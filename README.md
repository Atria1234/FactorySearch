# Factory Search

Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions?

"Where are the repair packs being made?"

"How many green belt machines do I have?"

"Which planet did I build my iron smelters on?"

If so, then Factory Search might be the mod for you!

Similar to [BeastFinder](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BeastFinder) and [Where is it Made?](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/WhereIsItMade)
