# Factory Search

Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions?

"Where are the repair packs being made?"

"How many green belt machines do I have?"

"Which planet did I build my iron smelters on?"

If so, then Factory Search might be the mod for you!

Similar to [BeastFinder](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BeastFinder) and [Where is it Made?](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/WhereIsItMade)

-----
## Features

- Press `Control + F` to open search interface
- Select any item or fluid
- Factory Search will present a list of machines that produce that item
- Machines are grouped by name and proximity
- Displays results from all surfaces (e.g. all Space Exploration planets are searched)
- Click on a result group to open it in the map
- Opens results from other planets in the Navigation Satellite if using Space Exploration
- Supports multiplayer

-----
## Future Updates?

- Option to search inventories (chests, cars, trains, spidertrons, corpses, etc)
- Temporary highlighting of the machines when you click to view them
- 'Expanded' view, with inline cameras like the train overview GUI (not for many monthsâ€¦)
